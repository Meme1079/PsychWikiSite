So am making a dumb website from my epic Psych Wiki repository. Cuz I really like to customize the wiki with more variety. What it adds is

- Back to top button
- Epic setting you change the code color and change the website into light theme (ewwww)
- Example and Lists of stuff have now epic color just like Warning and Note stuff

And also this in work in progress some things will be change
